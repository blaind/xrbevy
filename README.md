# Introduction

Proof-of-concept of getting [OpenXR](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/) rendering
support for [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) game engine using
[gfx-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/) abstractions.

**This repository is obsolete, see
[https://github.com/awtterpip/bevy_openxr](https://github.com/awtterpip/bevy_openxr)
for current implementation**

## Install

### Windows

Tested with Oculus Quest 2 using Oculus Link in Virtual Desktop mode (must be
enabled before starting app).

Clone this repository and run
[install_dependencies.bat](./scripts/install_dependencies.bat) to download
required dependencies (patched bevy, wgpu, openxrs crates, etc.):

    git clone https://github.com/blaind/xrbevy.git
    cd xrbevy
    .\scripts\install_dependencies.bat

Run the example scene using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

    cargo run --example xr_pc_scene --release

If you don't already have an openxr loader, the process will complain about
missing `openxr_loader.dll` file. One way to have a loader is to use a Khronos
loader:

1. Navigate to https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK-Source/releases/
1. Look for the latest release and a file called
   `openxr_loader_windows-[version].zip`
1. Copy `openxr_loader_windows\x64\bin\openxr_loader.dll` to `xrbevy` folder
   (from zip)

The loader must also be configured to point into correct runtime. For Oculus,
first install [Oculus app](https://www.oculus.com/setup/) and change the active
runtime through a registry editor. Open a terminal as administrator, and run:

    # Print current values
    reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenXR\1

    # Modify ActiveRuntime value to Oculus:
    reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenXR\1 /v ActiveRuntime /d "C:\Program Files\oculus\Support\oculus-runtime\oculus_openxr_64.json"

If errors, see [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

In future, to get the latest changes:

    .\scripts\update_dependencies.bat

### Ubuntu

**Note: tested only with Monado in virtual desktop mode, not with real
hardware**

Install needed dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install make libudev-dev libasound2-dev

Clone this repository and run a [Makefile](./Makefile) command to download
required dependencies (patched bevy, wgpu, openxrs crates, etc.):

    git clone https://github.com/blaind/xrbevy.git
    cd xrbevy
    make download_dependencies

Run the example scene using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/):

    cargo run --example xr_pc_scene --release

If you don't already have an openxr loader, the process will complain about
missing `openxr_loader.dll` file. Please try first One way to install a loader
is to use [Monado](https://monado.dev/) loader. Ubuntu installation:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:monado-xr/monado
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libopenxr-loader1

If you still get the error after retrying cargo run, try:

    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libopenxr_loader.so.1 /usr/local/lib/libopenxr_loader.so && sudo ldconfig

In addition to a loader, you'll need an OpenXR runtime: either virtualized like
Monado, or real like **maybe** (untested) SteamVR. For Monado, see
https://monado.freedesktop.org/getting-started.html#monado. If you find a way to
run with real hardware, please contact author or make a pull request to document
the steps here.

If errors, see [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

In future, to get the latest changes:

    make update_dependencies

### Mac OS

Currently untested. Please make a pull request if you get it working.

### Oculus Quest 2

Please note, that currently Quest 2 has a bug after exiting from app - might
require restart of the device or reinstall of the app to relaunch.

See [Oculus installation instructions](./docs/install_oculus.md)

# Background

Targets:

1. Demonstrate that OpenXR rendering is possible on Rust/GFX-RS/Bevy -ecosystem
1. Start the discussion with ecosystem participants about proper way to
   implement OpenXR support for Rust
1. Eventually have the basic building blocks in an easy-to-use state for
   building XR apps on top of bevy, or implementing XR support for other
   rendering engines

# Troubleshooting

## ERROR_FORM_FACTOR_UNAVAILABLE

    thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: ERROR_FORM_FACTOR_UNAVAILABLE', repos\gfx\src\backend\vulkan\src\xr.rs:63:14

Solution: Make sure that your device is connected

## OpenXR loader not found

    Could not load openxr loader. Make sure that you have openxr_loader.dll (Windows), libopenxr_loader.dylib (MacOS) or libopenxr_loader.so (Linux) in the library load path

Solution: follow the platform-specific installation instructions, and make sure
that one of the above files is present in library load path (or current path).

## Unknown wgpu/OpenXR extension

```
ADD INSTANCE EXTENSION! "VK_KHR_external_memory_capabilities"
ADD INSTANCE EXTENSION! "VK_KHR_external_fence_capabilities"
ADD INSTANCE EXTENSION! "VK_KHR_external_semaphore_capabilities"
ADD DEVICE EXTENSION! "VK_KHR_external_memory"
ADD DEVICE EXTENSION! "VK_KHR_external_memory_win32"
thread 'main' panicked at 'Unknown wgpu/OpenXR extension, add to openxr_extensions! macro: Unknown', repos\gfx\src\backend\vulkan\src\xr.rs:233:26
```

Solution: some of the extensions is missing from xr code. Please open a new
issue to this repository, or make a pull request directly into:
https://github.com/blaind/gfx/blob/bevy_openxr/src/backend/vulkan/src/xr.rs#L326
(last part with `openx_extensions!` macro). The format is as:

    (VK_KHR_EXTERNAL_SEMAPHORE_WIN32, "VK_KHR_external_semaphore_win32", 1048576),
     ^^^ all uppercase                 ^^ format as specific by OpenXR   ^^ pow2

For the pow2 number, take the max/latest number and multiply it by two to get a
next value.

## No OpenXR runtime found

    Error [GENERAL |  | OpenXR-Loader] : RuntimeManifestFile::FindManifestFiles - failed to find active runtime file in registry
    Error [GENERAL | xrEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties | OpenXR-Loader] : RuntimeInterface::LoadRuntimes - unknown error
    Error [GENERAL | xrEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties | OpenXR-Loader] : RuntimeInterface::LoadRuntimes - failed to load a runtime
    Error [GENERAL | xrEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties | OpenXR-Loader] : Failed to find default runtime with RuntimeInterface::LoadRuntime()
    Error [GENERAL | xrEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties | OpenXR-Loader] : Failed querying extension properties

Solution/Linux: Modify `/etc/xdg/openxr/1/` files based on your runtime (see
Google)

Solution/Windows: See the `ActiveRuntime` part of the Windows setup before
